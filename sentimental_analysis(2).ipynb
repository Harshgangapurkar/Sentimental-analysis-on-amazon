The first experience I had with an external battery and an iPhone4 was quite underwhelming to say the least.  Its 1200mAh capacity can only charge the old iPhone 4 from 0% to about 60% of its capacity while the phone is sitting idle.  It means very short hours on a 10+ hours oversea flight where entertainment on a mobile device is crucial.<br /><br />I'm pleasantly surprised by the NewTrent external battery and all the ports options it had.  It easily charges my HTC One X+ from zero to 100% charge twice including phone usage in between.<br /><br />One of the key feature that I liked the most is the little button on the external battery itself.  The external battery does not start charging automatically once your device when it's plugged in.  You will have to press the button to start charging.  That certainly prevented the external battery from draining too fast.<br /><br />I also like all the port options they offered on this external battery.  It pretty much covers all the port options you will need for your mobile devices.

The Iridium constellation provides excellent coverage and unit queues messages when it can't find a bird to communicate with.  I used the iPhone interface without any problems, it makes composing text messages a breeze.

The links work great and the maps are beautiful.  The people following me really appreciated the ability to reply right off the map link page.<br /><br />I had no trouble with activation.

The first experience I had with an external battery and an iPhone4 was quite underwhelming to say the least.  Its 1200mAh capacity can only charge the old iPhone 4 from 0% to about 60% of its capacity while the phone is sitting idle.  It means very short hours on a 10+ hours oversea flight where entertainment on a mobile device is crucial.<br /><br />I'm pleasantly surprised by the NewTrent external battery and all the ports options it had.  It easily charges my HTC One X+ from zero to 100% charge twice including phone usage in between.<br /><br />One of the key feature that I liked the most is the little button on the external battery itself.  The external battery does not start charging automatically once your device when it's plugged in.  You will have to press the button to start charging.  That certainly prevented the external battery from draining too fast.<br /><br />I also like all the port options they offered on this external battery.  It pretty much covers all the port options you will need for your mobile devices.  The 7000mAH capacity will certainly come in handy during oversea business trips.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lenght\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 538,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 15829,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2008,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2837,\n          491\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":74}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.tail()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"IS-gfket3Y-n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761058486388,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":70,"user":{"displayName":"Harsh Gangapurkar","userId":"14105492072228403469"}},"outputId":"75cd2960-27cc-40dd-8578-6f5e4fad07e9"},"execution_count":75,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                  Review  Sentiment  lenght\n","24995  These cables (lightning) are far superior to m...          1     280\n","24996  This unit performs exactly as advertised.

The Iridium constellation provides excellent coverage and unit queues messages when it can't find a bird to communicate with.  I used the iPhone interface without any problems, it makes composing text messages a breeze.  One small quibble: the down-arrow on my unit is a bit squirrelly - DeLorme offered to replace it no charge.<br /><br />Each message has a link to a website with a map of the location the message was sent from.  The links work great and the maps are beautiful.  The people following me really appreciated the ability to reply right off the map link page.<br /><br />I had no trouble with activation.
